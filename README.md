## Architecture Overview

The Habit Tracker app is built using JavaFX and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for organized and maintainable code.

### Main Components

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
  - **Habit**: Defines a habit's properties such as name, frequency, color, and start date.
  - **HabitRepository**: Manages CRUD operations for habits and handles data persistence.
- **View**: JavaFX `.fxml` files representing the UI elements.
  - **MainView**: Home screen displaying todayâ€™s habits and navigation options.
  - **AddHabitView** and **EditHabitView**: Screens for adding or editing habits.
  - **ProgressView**: Displays individual habit progress, statistics, and calendar completions.
  - **ReportView**: Shows monthly reports on habit performance.
  - **SettingsView** and **HelpView**: For configuration options and help documentation.
- **Controller**: Coordinates interactions between the Model and the View.
  - **MainController**: Manages application flow and updates the habit list and calendar.
  - **SettingsController**: Manages settings like reminders and dark mode.
  - **HelpController**: Loads help content and displays it in HelpView.
  - **ProgressController** and **ReportViewController**: Handle logic for progress and report data.
- **Utility Classes**:
  - **NotificationHelper**: Handles user notifications and reminders.
  - **BackupScheduler** and **JsonBackupHelper**: Manage data backup and restoration.

### Application Flow

- **Start-Up**: The `Main` class initializes `MainController`, which loads and manages views.
- **User Interactions**: Each view has a corresponding controller that listens for user actions and updates the Model via `HabitRepository`.
- **Data Persistence**: `HabitRepository` handles saving and retrieving data
- **Backup and Notifications**:
  - `BackupScheduler` manages scheduled data backups.
  - `JsonBackupHelper` enables manual backup and restore options.
  - `NotificationHelper` handles user notifications.

### Design Patterns and Principles

- **MVC Pattern**: Separates UI, business logic, and application flow for easier maintenance.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures only one instance of `HabitRepository` manages habit data.
- **Observer Pattern**: Allows views to observe changes in the Model for real-time updates.

### Class Interactions and Dependencies

- **MainController** orchestrates navigation and view management across the app.
- Specialized controllers like `SettingsController` and `HelpController` handle their respective views but rely on `MainController` for navigation.
- Utility classes support core functionality without cluttering the main controllers.
